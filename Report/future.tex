\section{Future Work}

Since there exit many variations of the three popular algorithms presented in this thesis, it would be interesting to compare different varieties of algorithms which performed best on the machine learning problem sets in order to find specific optimizations which work well with machine learning.

Another interesting research area is trying different ways of accomplishing the hybridization of principles from Estimation of Distribution Algorithms and Differential Evolution. One might, for instance, investigate whether the order in which model building and mutation are applied affects the algorithms performance.
