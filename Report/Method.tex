\subsection{Method}

A benchmark was constructed to perform the algorithm comparison. Both mathematical function optimization and machine learning test-sets were used. These are described in detail in the section \ref{section:benchmark}. Matlab was used to implement the algorithms and benchmarks because it provides easy access to important mathematical and scientific constructs which are usually not available in conventional programming languages. Matlab is also widely used in the field of evolutionary computation.
