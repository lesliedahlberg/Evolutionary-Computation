\section{Conclusions}

This thesis has compared four evolutionary algorithms on mathematical and machine learning benchmarks. The four algorithms are Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and my own algorithm Differential Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DEDA).

The algorithms perform similarly on many of the benchmark problems, while some problems showed wide ranging differences. For the mathematical benchmarks PSO and DEDA performed best, while DEDA and EDA worked best for machine learning problems on standard data sets. PSO produces the best results for neural network game controllers. The results show that combining features from DE and EDA into a new algorithm (DEDA) provides a clear benefit in machine learning and good performance overall.
