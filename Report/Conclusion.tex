\section{Conclusions}

This thesis has compared four algorithms on mathematical and machine learning benchmarks. The four algorithms are Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) and my own algorithm Differential Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (DEDA). PSO and DEDA produced the best results in general. DEDA has shown that by combining features from both DE and EDA both can be outperformed consistently.
